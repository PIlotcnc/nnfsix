# NNfSiX - Neural Networks from Scratch in `X`
Neural Networks from Scratch in X. This project is partially related to https://github.com/Sentdex/NNfSiX but does no follow the book. Rather than that this repository is going to include neural networks implemented in... well, we'll see :) For now it's Scratch only as a joke (Neural Networks from Scratch vs. Neural Networks in Scratch) and related to Neural Networks from Scratch in Python (https://nnfs.io) book I'm co-author of (next to Sentdex). In the future there should be more... unconventional implementations to be found here.
