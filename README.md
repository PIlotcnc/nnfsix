Neural Networks from Scratch in X  
This repository is going to include neural networks implemented in... well, we'll see :) For now it's Scratch only as a joke for April Fool's Day and related to Neural Networks from Scratch in Python (https://nnfs.io) book I'm co-author of (next to Sentdex). In the future there should be more... unconventional implementations to be found here.
