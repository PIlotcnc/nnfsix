# NNfSiX - Neural Networks from Scratch in `X`
Neural Networks from Scratch in X. This project is partially related to https://github.com/Sentdex/NNfSiX but does not follow the book.

This repository is going to include neural networks implemented in... well, we'll see :) For now it's Scratch only - initially made as a joke for April Fool's Day (Neural Networks from Scratch vs. Neural Networks in Scratch) and related to Neural Networks from Scratch in Python (https://nnfs.io) book I'm co-author of (next to Sentdex) - that also and some voices from the community lead to this project. In the future there should be more... unconventional implementations to be found here.
